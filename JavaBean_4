//A JavaBean is a java class that follows the following conventions:-
1. It should have private property.
2. It should provide public getter and setter methods to get and set the values in properties.
3. It should have public no-arg constructor or default constructor.


//A JavaBean object is an instance of java class. It is reusable, encapsulated java component with properties,getters and setters, designed for easy integration and manipulation.


//Bean Life cycle

1. Loading Bean definition:- 
Spring loads bean definition from various sources, such as xml configuration file, jav-based configuration classes or component scanning. These bean definition 			   contain information about the bean class, dependencies and other configuration details. 

2. Bean instantiation(means bean object create):- 
After bean definition are loaded, the spring container creates instances of beans based on these definitions. This involves invoking the bean class's constructor, either the default constructor or a specified constructor, to create an actual instance of the bean. The newly created bean instance is now ready for configuration and initialization. 

3. Bean initialisation:-
Once upon the bean is instantiated, spring proceeds to configure and initialize it. Property values are set using setters, constructor arguments, or field injection, populating the bean's state. 


4. Use bean object:- context.getBean   ke through

5. Bean destruction:- in this phase, Bean object is destroyed or deleted.  stdId will deleted


//BeanPostProcessor:- A "BeanPostProcessor" in spring is an interface that enables custom logic to be executed before and after the initialisation of spring beans.   It is come before and after Bean initialization.
